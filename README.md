# Project Title
**Hotel management system**
- The Hotel Management System project was developed as a semester-end assignment for the Computer Programming course. This program simulates the
core functionalities of a hotel management system, including room management, guest registration, and booking processes. The code is written in C++ and in-corporates fundamental programming concepts such as arrays, functions, loops, and conditionals, providing hands-on experience with real-world applications.

## Features
- Guest-interface
- Receptionist-interface
- Room-availability
- Check ins and checkouts
- Get user's data
- Display Rooms

## Project Objectives
1. To design a simple yet functional hotel management system for booking,
check-in, and check-out processes.
2. To implement data validation mechanisms for CNIC, phone numbers, and
other inputs.
3. To understand and utilize modular programming techniques by creating
reusable functions.
4. To practice error handling and input validation using conditionals and
loops.


## Usage
click on the Cpp code to use the ***Hotel Management System*** this will allow the user to enter data according to the user's demands and get the desired output.
